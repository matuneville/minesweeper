# Minesweeper ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥  
Starting from a group practice project for university in which we had to program the structural base of the minesweeper game, mainly coded with arrays (vectors) and matrices, 
I managed to program this simple graphical interface to play the game in the console, so that anyone can try it. Everithing is coded in C++ with CLion IDE. Group members are mentioned at the bottom.

## Game working
At first, you need to select the size of the square board and the amount of bombs for the game, which will determine the difficulty of the match.

Once the board is created, you have to select whether (1) you want to uncover a new square of the board, or (2) place a flag where you know or suspect there might be a bomb. Then the coordinates of the cell must be introduced (row and column).

And thus, you can win or lose the match.
