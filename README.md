# Minesweeper ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥  
Starting from a group practice work for university in which we had to program the structural base of the minesweeper game, mainly coded with arrays (vectors) and matrices, in C++, 
I succeeded to program this simple graphic interface to play the game in the console, so anyone can give it a try. It was all coded in CLion IDE. The group members are mentioned at the bottom.

## Game working
At first, you need to select the size of the square board and the amount of bombs for the game, which will determine the difficulty of the game.

Once the board is created, you have to select whether (1) you want to uncover a new square of the board, or (2) place a flag where you know or suspect there might be a bomb. Then the coordinates of the cell must be introduced.

And thus, you can win or lose the match.
